## How It All Began

Our motivation for this project was to increase our skills of organizing HTML files. I did not make this file from scratch. This file was given to us, and I made some important changes.

What I learned from this project was that you can have a lot of div commands to organize a HTML file but the down part for that is that when you or anyone else you are collaborating with goes back to make changes to the file, they will have a hard time making out what each section actually is.

For example, instead of div you can use some of these semantic elements:

- article
- aside
- details
- figcaption
- figure
- footer
- header
- main
- mark
- nav
- section
- summary
- time

The benefit of using scemantic elements is that when you see something labeled as figcaption you know this is the caption for a figure.
if this wasnt the case you would have hundreds of divs to go through before you found the necessary one.

We also learned about accessible alternate attributes, which is a caption near a line of code for an image explaining what the image is.
Beneficial because it helps you diferentiate between multiple Img codes by having a description.
